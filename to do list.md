# AR Learning App - Project Status & Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is an AR-enhanced learning app that combines:
- **Traditional learning flow**: video → quiz → summary
- **AR poster scanning** with MindAR
- **Topic-specific animations**
- **Location-based content delivery**

## ✅ What's Already Built

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **State Management System** | ✅ Complete | 10 states with lifecycle hooks: loading → campus_selection → menu → scanning → ar_ready → animating → video → quiz → summary |
| **AR Scene Manager** | ✅ Complete | Dynamic A-Frame scene creation for each topic, integrated with state manager |
| **Topic Mapping** | ✅ Complete | web(0), marketing(1), data(2), cyber(3) |
| **Modular Structure** | ✅ Complete | CSS in `core/css/style.css`, JS in `core/js/`, clean separation of concerns |
| **Core Files** | ✅ Complete | `stateManager.js`, `arSceneManager.js`, `topics.js` |

## 🔄 Current Flow Design

1. User scans 1 of 4 physical posters
2. MindAR identifies which poster (maps to topic)
3. AR scene loads for that specific topic
4. Topic-specific animation plays
5. Traditional learning flow begins (video → quiz → summary)
6. Progress tracked and saved locally

## 🚧 What's Missing (Critical Path)

| Component | Status | Impact |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **HTML Sections** | ❌ Missing | No UI for new states - **BLOCKS EVERYTHING** |
| **Animation Files** | ❌ Missing | No topic-specific timeline files |
| **MindAR Integration** | ❌ Missing | No camera/permission handling |
| **Progress System** | ❌ Missing | No completion tracking |
| **Component Integration** | ❌ Missing | Components not connected yet |

## 🎨 Design Decisions Made

- Keep existing globals (no complex state management)
- Use regular script tags (not ES6 modules) for local development
- Separate animation files per topic (not one master file)
- Dynamic AR scene creation (not hardcoded scenes)
- Required lifecycle hooks for all states

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- App starts in 'loading' state
- AR scenes created on-demand when topics detected
- Each topic gets its own animation timeline
- Progress saved to localStorage
- Fallback needed for non-AR devices

## 📁 File Locations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| **Main App** | `app.html` |
| **Core JS** | `core/js/` |
| **Core CSS** | `core/css/` |
| **Animations** | `core/js/animations/` (to be created) |

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- No error handling for camera permissions
- No fallback for unsupported devices
- No loading states for assets
- No progress persistence yet
